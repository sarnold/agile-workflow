The Agile Manifesto
===================

Agile Software Development
--------------------------

*A set of guiding principles for software development under which requirements and solutions evolve through the collaborative effort of self-organizing and cross-functional teams and their customer(s)/end user(s)*

Core Concepts (paraphrased)
---------------------------

* Early and continuous delivery of value to the customer

* Harness change for the customer's competitive advantage

* Business people and developers work together daily

* Use the most effective communication tools available (f2f is "best")

* A working system is the primary measure of progress

* Agile processes must be sustainable

* Simplicity in design and implementation is essential

* Reflect on how to become more effective (each iteration)


What is an Agile Process?
=========================

* Follows the core principles laid out in the `Agile Manifesto`_

  - Iterative, collaborative, sustainable, self-reflective
  - Embraces change, customer/user-focused
  - Each iteration delivers a working product

* Takes advantage of appropriate tools/models

  - Workflow based on appropriate Agile Workflow Model(s)
  - Uses appropriate tools to facilitate the workflow

      + Software development tools
      + Test/continuous integration tools
      + Communication/collaboration tools
      + Project/operations management tools

* Communicates frequently using multiple modalities

  - Actual face-to-face mtgs
  - Text/voice/video chat
  - Tool push notifications
  - Project dashboard

Agile Project Management
========================

*Agile project management refers to an incremental approach to managing projects that helps teams address and respond to change and uncertainty over the course of a project life cycle*

The core principles of agile PM are largely based on the Agile Manifesto (initially developed for software development), and emphasize:


* The importance of collaboration in fostering innovation
* The significance of feedback loops and iterative workflows in facilitating inspection and continuous improvement
* The value in embracing and responding to change over blindly following a plan
